// Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

// Note:

// Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
// In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.


const hammingWeight = (n) => {


    return (n.toString(2).split("1")).length - 1;


};


console.log(hammingWeight(00000000000000000000000000001011));
